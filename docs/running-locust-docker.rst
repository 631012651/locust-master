Running Locust with Docker
=================================

The official Docker image is currently found at `locustio/locust <https://hub.docker.com/r/locustio/locust>`_.

The docker image can be used like this (assuming that the ``locustifile.py`` exists in the current working directory)::

    docker run -p 8089:8089 -v $PWD:/mnt/locust locustio/locust -f /mnt/locust/locustfile.py


Docker Compose
==============

Here's an example Docker Compose file that could ber used to start both a master node, and slave nodes:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml
    :language: yaml

The above compose configuration could be used to start a master node and 4 workers using the following command::

    docker-compose up --scale worker=4


Use docker image as a base image
================================

It's very common to have test scripts that rely on third party python packages. In those cases you can use the 
official Locust docker image as a base image::

    FROM locustio/locust
    RUN pip3 install some-python-package
